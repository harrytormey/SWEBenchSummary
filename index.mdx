# Introduction

The SWEBench project is a comprehensive framework for evaluating large language models (LLMs) on software engineering tasks. This project aims to provide a standardized benchmark for assessing the performance of LLMs in tackling various software engineering challenges, such as code understanding, bug fixing, and code generation.

In the software engineering domain, the rapid advancements in LLM technologies have generated a lot of excitement and potential for automating various tasks. SWEBench is designed to serve as a centralized platform for researchers, developers, and practitioners to evaluate the capabilities of these models and drive further progress in the field.

## The Purpose of SWEBench

The primary goals of the SWEBench project are:

1. **Establishing a Standardized Benchmark**: SWEBench aims to create a standardized and comprehensive benchmark for evaluating LLMs on a diverse set of software engineering tasks. This benchmark will help researchers and developers assess the performance of their models in a consistent and comparable manner.

2. **Fostering Collaboration and Innovation**: By providing a shared platform for evaluating LLMs, SWEBench encourages collaboration among researchers and developers. This collaborative effort can lead to the development of more robust and efficient LLM architectures and techniques for software engineering applications.

3. **Driving Progress in the Field**: The insights and findings from the SWEBench project can directly inform the development of more capable and reliable LLMs for software engineering tasks. This, in turn, can accelerate the adoption of these technologies in real-world software development workflows.
