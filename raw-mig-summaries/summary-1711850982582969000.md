### /Users/harrytormey/Documents/Code/SWE-bench/versioning/extract_web/get_versions_pydicom.py

#### Purpose and Functionality:
- This file is responsible for extracting version information for the Pydicom library.
- It retrieves version data from a specific webpage, matches it with task instances, and saves the updated task instances with version information.

#### Third-Party Libraries:
- `requests`: Used for making HTTP requests to retrieve webpage content.
- `BeautifulSoup`: Utilized for parsing HTML content to extract specific data from the webpage.

#### Data Flow:
1. Retrieves task instances from a specified path.
2. Fetches version data from a webpage related to Pydicom.
3. Parses the HTML content to extract version information.
4. Matches the version data with task creation dates to assign versions to tasks.
5. Saves the updated task instances with version information to a specified path.

#### Potential Improvements:
- Error handling for cases where the webpage structure changes.
- Implementing caching mechanisms to avoid unnecessary HTTP requests.
- Enhancing the version matching algorithm for more accurate results.
